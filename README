Project to see my Pool Manager in action.

In Demo_Scene/Manager/PoolManager you can create different pools for each object you need,
adding a element to the list, inserting the object prefabs , the pool name and the initial quantity.
In this way the PoolManager will instantiate a pool for each object of the indicated quantity as child of PoolManager.

Once the scene is played, with the SpaceBar the player starts/stops shooting , by taking an object from the pool,
if the pool is too small and there are not enough objects a new one is instantiated at runtime and taken.

In the Player you can edit the FireRate, while in the Bullet prefab you can edit the MoveSpeed ​​and the Duration,
when the pooled object is deactivated it becomes available again to be taken again.

In this scene the pooled object does not have a particular behavior, 
but if necessary you can add a particular behavior and ResetMethod (e.g. some model deactivated, particle reset, scale changed) if some parameters have been modified during the active life of the object.
